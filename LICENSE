## Rationale

### Why This License Exists

BarrerSoftware releases software for FREE because:

1. **Built on free resources**
   - We use public specifications
   - We study open source code
   - We learn from community work
   - What was given freely, must remain free

2. **Accessibility matters**
   - Students can't always afford software
   - Developing countries need access
   - Hobbyists deserve good tools
   - Open source democratizes technology

3. **Quality over profit**
   - We build what we want to use
   - Profit motives corrupt good design
   - Community feedback makes better software
   - Free software forces excellence

4. **Anti-exploitation**
   - We've seen companies take free software and profit billions
   - Original creators get nothing
   - We protect our work from being sold by others
   - Services are fine, selling software is not
