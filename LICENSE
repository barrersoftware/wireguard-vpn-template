## Rationale

### Why This License Exists

BarrerSoftware releases most software for FREE because:

1. **Built on free resources**
   - We use public specifications
   - We study open source code
   - We learn from community work
   - What was given freely, must remain free

2. **Accessibility matters**
   - Students can't always afford software
   - Developing countries need access
   - Hobbyists deserve good tools
   - Everyone should have opportunity

3. **Community over commerce**
   - We profit from 2 paid products only
   - Everything else is free
   - If we don't profit from it, no one should
   - Fair and ethical

### The Problem We're Solving

We've observed companies:
- Fork free/open source software
- Add minimal "enterprise features"
- Charge significant fees
- Profit from community work

**Examples:**
- Forked package managers sold as "enterprise"
- Free tools rebranded and monetized
- Community work exploited for profit

**BarrerSoftware will not allow this.**

### Our Commitment

BarrerSoftware's free software will NEVER:
- Be sold by us
- Be paywalled
- Have premium tiers
- Require subscriptions

**We set the example.**

**We enforce the rule.**
